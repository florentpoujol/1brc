# 1 Billion Row Challenge in PHP

This is my solution for the 1 billion rows challenge (https://1brc.dev), in PHP.

Create measurements.txt file : 
```php
php createMeasurements.php {number of reccords}
```

If you do have php installed locally but have docker, use `./phpd` instead of `php` to run the command dockerized.
